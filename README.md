Instacart is an online grocery store that allows customers to order from a variety of goods such as baby formula to household appliances through the power of your fingertips via an app. Instacart has been performing well as of late but they wish to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 

We've been tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of their consumer and inventory data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation. With these insights, Instacart can better bolster their sales and enhance their marketing to particular customer segments.

## Key Questions and Objectives

The Instacart team has requested the following questions to be explored and addressed:

- When is days and times of the week are Instacart orders the busiest?
- What times of the day are when people spend the most money?
- Determine a simpler approach to group price ranges
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- The marketing and sales teams are interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ
	- What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
	- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
	- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
	- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
	- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest (i.e., age, income, certain types of goods, family status)?
	- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
